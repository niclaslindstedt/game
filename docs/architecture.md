# Architecture

## The shape of the project

This is a **webapp-kind** project per OSS_SPEC §11.4: the deployed website
_is_ the game. There is no marketing site — every build artifact is the
playable app.

Two layers with a one-way dependency:

```
website/  (the app: Vite + React PWA shell, rendering, deploy concerns)
   │  imports via @game/core
   ▼
src/      (the engine: framework-free TypeScript game logic)
```

### `src/` — the engine

Pure TypeScript with no React and no build-tool coupling. The simulation is
deterministic by construction: `createGame(seed, levelId?, difficulty?)`
builds the level from a seeded RNG, and `step(state, input, dtMs)` advances
it with a fixed timestep — the same seed, difficulty, and input sequence
always replays the same run, which is what makes gameplay unit-testable in
plain Node and bugs reproducible.

Content is data, simulation is code: the game's levels, monsters,
equipment, and cutscenes live in **catalogs** under `src/game/defs/`, and
the engine only ever references them by id. Shipping level 12 or the
hundredth weapon means adding catalog entries, not touching the simulation.
The def accessors read an overridable registry, so `registerDefs(...)` can
swap the active catalogs for a custom set — the engine test suites use it to
run against synthetic fixtures with no shipped content (see
`tests/engine/fixtures.ts`).

- **`src/game/config.ts`** — the GLOBAL balance knobs (player, jumping, XP
  curve, stat effects, loot rules), nothing hardcoded in logic.
- **`src/game/defs/levels/`** — the level registry: one `LevelDef` per file
  (`spacez_hq.ts`, `moon.ts`, …) merged and ordered by `levels/index.ts`
  (which owns `LEVELS`, `LEVEL_ORDER`, `levelDef`; the split keeps each
  level's ~250 lines under the source-size cap as the campaign grows). A
  level carries geometry, per-level gravity (low gravity makes jumps soar),
  biome (a `tiles` sprite spec the renderer paints from), an optional `music`
  track id (a key into the app's `LEVEL_TRACKS` registry — the engine stays
  audio-free), the hero's opening monologue (`intro`, one array of lines per
  page — a black-screen dialogue the hero speaks over before the level-name
  card drops the run in),
  an optional prelude cutscene id, landmark props, banded enemy spawns (each
  spawn/wave line may carry an optional `minDifficulty` so difficulty-gated
  content lives with the level that uses it), the
  objective (`killBoss` / `clearAll`), solid obstacles (tall pieces block
  everyone — including sight, shots and a nuke's blast; low/jumpable ones like
  craters can be cleared by the player but never by monsters; a `rockSizes`
  spec scatters rectangular rock footprints that collide as a box, not a
  circle), deliberate `walls` (segments expanded into chains of solid circles
  at creation — door gaps between segments carve rooms),
  locked `doors` (chains of `door_locked` obstacles tracked in
  `state.doors`, opened by carrying the matching story-item key up to
  them), hand-`placedItems` (locked-room loot, plot pieces on pedestals),
  decor, and the loot table (the level's thematic base pools — tier
  availability is the global monster-level gate, not per-level data).
- **`src/game/defs/enemies/`** — the monster catalog, split one file per
  roster (`spacez.ts`, `moon.ts`, …) merged into `ENEMY_DEFS` by
  `enemies/index.ts` (which throws on a duplicate id): stats, AI radii,
  roles; bosses and elites pin guaranteed drops). Roles: `minion` (the
  horde), `boss` (guards the objective), and `elite` — a unique story mob
  pinned to a spot by the level def, which sleeps until the player nears,
  rushes into view at `ai.rushSpeed`, delivers its `dialogue` pages (the
  run pauses in the `dialogue` phase), then fights like a mid-boss and
  drops a signature weapon plus story items. Bosses carry longer
  `dialogue` for the stare-down before the fight. Every unique mob also
  carries `lastWords` — a short dying gasp replayed through the same
  dialogue box (an `enemyDeath` scene) as it falls, so a story death lands
  harder than a nameless minion's. A unique may instead be `spareable`: at
  0 hp it kneels for the SPARE-or-KILL verdict, and spared it joins the
  party as the named companion (see `companions.ts` below). This game's
  actual roster (and the story it tells) is in
  [`game-content.md`](./game-content.md).
- **`src/game/defs/companions.ts`** — the companion catalog: who a spared
  unique becomes. Each def carries the sprite family (the enemy twin's), a
  base hp that grows with the hero's level, a signature starting weapon, an
  optional party-wide `aura` (LUCKY's +50% magic find), the `joinWords`
  scene played the moment the SPARE verdict lands, and the `killQuotes`
  banter floated over the companion when its blow downs a mob.
- **`src/game/defs/story.ts`** — the story-item catalog: plot pieces
  (keycards, dossiers, recovered hardware) dropped by elites or placed in
  locked rooms. Pickups bank into `state.storyItems` (never the bag) and
  play their `lore` pages as a dialogue; an `unlocks` entry makes the item
  the key for the matching level door.
- **`src/game/defs/cutscenes.ts`** — the cutscene catalog: pure-data scenes
  (a stage of props, a cast, a beat timeline) played by the generic
  `@game/lib/cutscene` state machine. A level references a scene via its
  `prelude` field; the run then opens in the `cutscene` phase (the sim
  frozen underneath), advanced by `step()` on the same clock. Motion beats
  run on that clock; text beats crawl in letter by letter and hold until
  `tapCutscene` (JRPG-style), and `skipCutscene` bails the whole opening —
  the prelude _and_ the hero's level-intro monologue that follows — landing
  on the level-name `title` card just before the drop. The opening flow is
  `cutscene` (if any) → `intro` (the hero's monologue) → `title` (the level
  name alone on black) → `playing`.
- **`src/game/defs/equipment.ts`** — weapons (melee/ranged/magic classes,
  each with a Diablo-style `levelReq` that gates both the drop — no monster
  below it drops the base — and the hero's own hands, plus a durability
  budget: dropped weapons wear out per attack and break, though the starting
  sidearm and every unique/legendary find are minted unbreakable; ranged
  bases can fire pellet volleys, pierce, home, or chain), gear, the
  five-tier quality ladder (regular/magic/rare/unique/legendary — each tier
  unlocks at a MONSTER LEVEL, config `LOOT.tierUnlockMlvl`), and the affix
  pools magic+ items roll, whose magnitudes scale with the drop's ITEM LEVEL
  (the killer's monster level minus a small weighted deficit; magic+ names
  are composed Diablo-style from those affixes). Two more axes complete the
  tables: **base grades** (`defs/grades.ts` — every pool base ships
  generated EXCEPTIONAL and ELITE versions, same look, new names, level
  requirements remapped up to 100, damage/armor re-derived on the balance
  curves; `rollEquipment` folds them into each level's pool at roll time)
  and **make quality** (every PLAIN regular-tier weapon/armor drop rolls
  BROKEN → CRUDE → NORMAL → SUPERIOR → PERFECT per instance, odds sliding
  with the killer's monster level, scaling its damage/armor/durability/value
  — config `QUALITY`; craftsmanship and magic are exclusive D2-style, so
  magic-or-better finds, charms, and bags stay normal make).
- **`src/game/defs/abilities.ts`** — the ability pickups: time-limited
  powers (orbiting fire orbs, storm strikes, stasis slow fields, the item
  magnet whose pull radius grows with INTELLIGENCE) plus the instant
  screen nuke (kills every non-boss monster on screen, its drop rate kept
  rare by `LOOT.nukeShare`); levels choose which can drop via their
  `loot.abilityPool`. Pickups are banked into `player.heldAbilities` (up
  to `HELD_ITEMS.cap`) and spent with the `useItem` input, or dragged out
  of their dock slot to be discarded (`discardHeldAbility`) when the bank
  is full of powers you don't want. A spent power does not vacate its slot:
  it keeps counting down in place (`ActiveAbility.slot` links a running copy
  to its dock slot), and only when it lapses does the slot free and the rest
  shift down (`removeHeldSlot`) — so the dock stays full while a power runs
  and no new pickup can bank over it. The instant screen nuke is the
  exception: it fires and frees its slot at once. A `stackable` power (fire
  orbs, storm cell) runs several copies at once — each activation adds a
  fresh instance from its own slot, so two storm cells strike twice as often;
  a non-stackable one (the magnet) refuses to re-enable while a copy is
  running, keeping the pickup banked.
- **`src/game/defs/difficulties.ts`** — the difficulty ladder (EASY →
  MEDIUM → HARD → NIGHTMARE → JESUS CHRIST!), chosen on the main menu and
  layered over every level. A rung turns a whole rack of knobs: the hero's
  opening kit (`startingWeapon` — the wall weapon, mirrored by a
  per-difficulty prelude variant — and `startingStats`), spawn counts and
  the wave spawner's live cap, the horde's RELATIVE level (`mobLevelOffset`
  — every monster spawns at player level + offset, hp shifted per level by
  `MENACE.mobHpPerLevel`), the drop economy (medkit/armor/powerup
  multipliers down, drop-chance/tier bonuses up — and since a rung's
  `mobLevelOffset` raises MONSTER level, the hard rungs also reach every
  tier's unlock gate earlier; `uniqueDropChance` draws from a level's
  `loot.uniquePool` once unique items exist), the stamina burn, dodge/miss accuracy multipliers, and the
  menace meter's trigger/decay/effect. MEDIUM is the exact 1.0 baseline.
- **`src/game/abilities.ts`** — ability activation (`grantAbility`, which
  links the running copy to the dock slot it was spent from), freeing a slot
  when a power lapses or is discarded (`removeHeldSlot`, `discardHeldAbility`),
  and the helpers the renderer shares (`orbPositions`, `stasisFactorAt`); the
  per-tick behavior runs inside `step.ts` so all damage flows through one path.
- **`src/game/types.ts`** — state shapes plus the `GameEvent` union: events
  are the only channel from simulation to presentation (sound, flashes);
  the engine never knows a renderer or speaker exists.
- **`src/game/create.ts`** — seeded run setup from a level def: difficulty
  bands scale with distance from the player spawn toward the objective.
- **`src/game/step.ts`** — the per-tick pipeline, in documented order:
  player steering + jump physics (+ obstacle push-out) → use-item edge →
  weapon auto-attack (wearing the weapon's durability) → abilities →
  projectiles → enemies (aggro/guard/elite AI, dialogue triggers, contact
  damage, obstacle push-out) → hazards (gravity wells, asteroids) → menace
  decay → wave spawner → item pickups →
  locked doors → objective → win/lose. A boss at or below `LAST_STAND.hpFraction`
  multiplies its contact damage — the one-last-stand spike the renderer
  telegraphs with a flickering dying sprite. The character fights autonomously (and only
  targets monsters inside the visible view the app passes in
  `input.view`) — it locks the nearest visible foe, but a desktop mouse adds an
  aim dimension: `input.aim` (the pointer's world position) biases the pick
  toward whatever the cursor points at (`AIM.biasStrength`), so foes in the
  pointer's direction outrank merely-closer ones elsewhere; the player steers,
  jumps (tap/Space), spends banked
  ability pickups (`input.useItem`), spends level-up stat points, and
  manages the inventory. Level-ups restore full health, land automatic
  base-attribute gains (see `leveling.ts` below), and celebrate first: the
  ding arms `state.levelUpFxMs` (config `LEVELING.dingCelebrationMs`) — the
  app draws the golden burn off it — and the `levelup` stat-chooser phase
  only opens once the window has burned down. Golden XP arrows
  grant a fixed share of the current threshold. Picked-up equipment that
  beats what is worn is equipped on the spot.
- **`src/game/loot.ts`** — kill resolution: `hitEnemy` applies player
  damage (crit rolls flash the victim), pays out XP, and rolls drops —
  the level's loot table for minions (with the pity rule and the
  all-clear trophy), the def's guaranteed drops for bosses and elites.
  It also feeds the menace meter on each kill and power-scales an
  elite/boss to the player on its first blow.
- **`src/game/leveling.ts`** — the automatic base-attribute growth (the
  WoW-style ding gains, config `LEVELING.autoGainsPerLevel`): each level
  grants `round(rate × level)` points of the listed stats on its own,
  underneath the chosen point. Everything is DERIVED from `player.level`
  (`baseStatBonus`, folded into `effectiveStat`) — never written into
  `player.stats`, so a respec refunds only chosen points — and
  `autoPowerScale` expresses the damage curve those free gains produce so
  the horde's scaling can cancel it out.
- **`src/game/menace.ts`** — the escalation system: the player's rolling
  DPS/kill-rate (`tickMenace`) plus relative-overkill jolts on a killing
  blow (`bankOverkill`) bank `state.menace`, which idle time bleeds off (a
  fixed decay, also in `tickMenace`, run from `step.ts`). All gain is scaled
  by `menaceSensitivity` — the difficulty's `menaceMult` times an early-game
  `menaceWarmup` — so a rampage takes a genuinely overpowered build, is
  practically impossible in the opening levels, and gets touchier the harder
  the difficulty. Its `menaceStage` lures a denser
  horde (`lureMult`, read by the wave spawner), evolves freshly-spawned
  minions (`evolutionHpMult`, stamped in `create.ts`'s `spawnEnemy`), and
  — with the player's level — power-matches elites/bosses when they engage
  (`enemyPowerScale`/`maybePowerScale`, called from both `step.ts` wake and
  `loot.ts` first-hit). Separately from that moment-to-moment heat, the
  player's LEVEL alone gives every minion a non-decaying toughness floor at
  spawn (`mobLevelScale`, folded into `spawnEnemy`'s hp mult) and richer
  drops (`mobLevelTierBonus`, added to the loot tier roll), so a levelled
  hero keeps meeting a proportionally sturdier, better-paying horde. Both
  the minion floor and the elite/boss power-match multiply by
  `autoPowerScale` (leveling.ts) — the free per-level stat gains cancel out
  against the crowd, so only chosen points, gear, and skill pull ahead.
- **`src/game/hazards.ts`** — environmental hazards, both pure level data:
  **gravity wells** (`LevelDef.wells`, config `WELLS`) drag the grounded
  player/enemies/items toward their core — minions are devoured there
  (`wellSwallowed`: no kill, no XP, no loot, so a hole can't be farmed),
  the player burns on a damage tick, dragged items park on the rim, and a
  jump clears the pull entirely — and the **asteroid rain**
  (`LevelDef.asteroids`, config `ASTEROIDS`): rocks spawned on a ring past
  the screen edge streak across the player (one strike per rock, jumpable,
  armor reduces) and shove minions aside unharmed. Related:
  **apparitions** (`EnemyDef.apparition`, config `APPARITION`) are
  dialogue-only figures the combat/hazard paths all skip — they rush in to
  speak like any elite, then walk off and dissolve (`apparitionVanished`).
- **`src/game/story.ts`** — the story systems: dialogue lifecycle
  (`wantsDialogue`/`startEnemyDialogue` inside the step,
  `advanceDialogue` as the player's tap, `dialogueContent` for the
  renderer), story-item collection, and `stepDoors` (a carried key
  removes its door's obstacle chain). Dialogue freezes the run in the
  `dialogue` phase exactly like the level-up chooser.
- **`src/game/companions.ts`** — the COMPANION system and the SPARE-or-KILL
  verdict (config `COMPANIONS`): a spareable unique (`EnemyDef.spareable`)
  beaten to 0 hp kneels and pauses the run in the `choice` phase (the
  interception lives in `hitEnemy`); `resolveChoice` lands the call — KILL
  books the withheld blow through `killEnemy`, SPARE recruits the figure as
  a party companion (`recruitCompanion`, its `joinWords` scene via story.ts).
  `stepCompanions` (right after the enemy pass) walks the party's formation,
  picks fights inside the hero's engagement bubble, strikes/shoots on the
  weapon's cadence (shots ride the ordinary projectile pass, tagged
  `companionId` for kill-quote attribution), soaks the horde's contact
  swings against helmet+chest armor, and beats companions DOWN — never
  dead — until they stand back up on their own. Companion auras
  (`CompanionDef.aura` — LUCKY's +50% magic find, read by items.ts
  `magicFindBonus` inside every tier roll) go silent while downed. The UI's
  mutators are `equipCompanionFromInventory` / `unequipCompanionToInventory`
  (weapon/helmet/chest only) and the `companion` pause-phase toggles
  `openCompanionPanel` / `closeCompanionPanel`; the party rides the loadout
  (`Loadout.companions`) between levels.
- **`src/game/map.ts`** — the level map and its fog of war: run-scoped
  exploration as a coarse byte grid on the state (`state.explored`, one cell
  per config `MAP.cellSize` world px), stamped around the hero every step
  (`revealAround`, called from `step()`; the spawn is pre-revealed at
  creation) and queried with `isExplored`. Memorable events pin
  `state.mapMarkers` via `addMapMarker` — story-item finds (story.ts),
  unique/legendary pickups (the pickup switch in step.ts), and elite/boss
  victories including fled uniques (loot.ts). `openMap`/`closeMap` toggle the
  `map` pause phase (frozen sim, level-up priority on close) for the HUD's
  MAP button / the M key.
- **`src/game/merchant.ts`** — the WANDERING MERCHANT and his coin economy
  (config `MERCHANT` / `ECONOMY`): one trader per level (`state.merchant`,
  minted at creation on his own seeded rng stream — parked as a plain
  `rngState` number so a saved run freezes him losslessly — and never
  drawing the run's stream, so his existence reshuffles no loot roll).
  He wanders until met; the first close encounter (`stepMerchant`, inside
  the step) roots him for good, pins the map (`merchant` marker), rolls his
  stall against the hero's level, emits `merchantDiscovered`, and plays the
  level's greeting scene (`LevelDef.merchant` — sprite, name, and pages;
  the words live in `docs/manuscript.md`). His ward (`repelFromMerchant`,
  called from the enemy pass) keeps the horde `MERCHANT.repelRadius` off
  the stall — bosses and apparitions excepted. `openShop`/`closeShop`
  toggle the `shop` pause phase (proximity-gated); `sellItem`/`buyStock`
  are the UI's trade mutators, and `sellValue` is the one valuation every
  price tag reads — item level × tier orders of magnitude × material
  (metal ×2, precious ×4, from the equipment defs). Coins live on the
  player and ride the loadout between levels.
- **`src/game/items.ts`** — equipment instances and the player-driven
  mutations the UI calls into: loot rolls, `equipFromInventory` /
  `unequipToInventory` / `moveInventoryItem`, the one-tap bag tools
  (`autoEquipBest` — wear the best wearable piece in every slot at once,
  weapons by the build-aware `weaponScore`; `scrapInferiorLoot` — cull every
  outgrown find), `allocateStat` (plus the
  respec trio `beginRespec` / `deallocateStat` / `confirmRespec`),
  the derived
  stats (max hp — now STAMINA-scaled, class-aware crit chance
  `playerCritChance` — DEX for physical, INT for magic, LUCK marginal — the
  `playerDodgeChance` sidestep, weapon damage (STR scales physical harder than
  INT scales magic), STR-taxed move speed, INT-scaled reach
  `weaponRangeFor`, swing/fire cadence `weaponCooldownFor` — the catalog
  cooldown slowed by the global `WEAPON.baseCooldownMult` and quickened by the
  speed stat — and the swing cone `weaponSweepHalfAngle` that, capped by
  `maxMeleeTargets` (INT raises the cap), makes a swing cleave the nearest few
  monsters it faces), the auto-equip scoring (`weaponScore` DPS /
  `gearScore`) and the crit-inclusive `weaponDps` the item cards lead with,
  and the durability cycle
  (`wearEquippedWeapon` — a broken weapon is trashed and the best bag
  weapon takes over; `wearWornArmor` — armor spends a point per landed hit
  and a piece at zero goes INACTIVE (`isArmorBroken`), never trashed — and
  `repairEquippedWeapon` + `repairWornArmor` for repair-kit drops, which
  mend the weapon's edge and the whole wardrobe together). Worn armor sums
  into a level-scaled physical reduction (`totalArmor`/`armorReduction`,
  config `ARMOR` — the D2/WoW diminishing-returns curve). Every drop is minted with a FROZEN snapshot of its
  catalog def (`Equipment.def`), so a kept item is version-proof: rebalancing
  or deleting a base changes only new drops, never one a player already holds.
  On load the app runs each persisted instance through `adoptEquipment`, which
  parks that snapshot under a synthetic frozen id (`registerFrozenDef`) and
  re-homes the item onto it — so every stat read (`weaponDef`/`gearDef` and
  everything routing through them) resolves the item exactly as it dropped,
  even when its original base is gone. `baseDefId` sees back through the
  re-homing to the item's original base id.
- **`src/game/bot.ts`** — the autopilot: pure strategies (`idle`, `rush`,
  `kite`, `boss`, `survivor`) that turn the live state into ordinary
  `GameInput`, so a bot can sit anywhere a player does — headless tests,
  the app's `?bot=` autoplay mode, and later an AI-driven second player.
- **`src/lib/`** — generic, game-agnostic helpers (`vec.ts`, `rng.ts`,
  `cutscene.ts` — the deterministic beat-machine cutscene player),
  imported via the `@game/lib/*` alias and earmarked for extraction into
  oss-framework once mature (extraction is then a prefix swap).
- **`src/index.ts`** — the public surface the app imports via `@game/core`.

`src/output.ts` remains the central output module (OSS_SPEC §19.4) through
which all diagnostic output flows: semantic helpers
(`status`/`warn`/`info`/`header`/`error`/`debug`), an always-on in-memory
log buffer (`recentLogs()`), and a debug switch (`?debug` URL param or
`setDebugEnabled`). Raw `console.*` calls outside this module fail lint.

### `website/` — the app

A Vite + React 19 shell that mounts the engine and owns everything
deploy-shaped:

- **`website/src/App.tsx`** — the app shell: splash main menu ↔ the game,
  plus the cutscene workbench route (`?cutscene=<id>`).
- **`website/src/game/`** — the presentation of the engine:
  `TitleScreen.tsx` (the Doom-style splash menu: starfield, logo,
  keyboard-and-pointer navigation, NEW GAME → the difficulty ladder,
  SETTINGS → controls + volumes, HOW TO PLAY), `GameScreen.tsx` (canvas
  mount, fixed-timestep loop, control-scheme input mapping, HUD with hp/XP
  bars and the banked-item USE button, end-of-run splash),
  `IntroOverlay.tsx` (the level's story text box + chosen difficulty),
  `CutsceneOverlay.tsx` (draws a running scene — backdrop, props, cast,
  fade — while the engine sits in the `cutscene` phase; dialogue floats in
  a box over the stage bottom and waits for TAP, SKIP ends the scene) and
  `CutscenePreview.tsx` (the
  `?cutscene=<id>` workbench that loops one scene outside any run),
  `LevelUpOverlay.tsx` (the stat chooser shown while the engine pauses in
  `levelup`; folds into a 3×2 grid on landscape phones),
  `RespecOverlay.tsx` (the respec — a Diablo-style attribute
  screen shown in the `respec` phase, with a −/+ stepper per stat and a
  CONFIRM gate; shares the stat catalog with the level-up chooser via
  `statChoices.tsx`),
  `InventoryPanel.tsx` (the Diablo-style bag: drag-to-equip slots,
  tier-colored borders, item card, character sheet), `MapOverlay.tsx` (the
  fog-of-war level map shown in the `map` phase — one chunky pixel of
  terrain per explored fog cell, dark where the hero hasn't been, with a
  legend of event pins: story finds, elite/boss kills, the merchant, and the
  hero's own position), `render.ts` (camera +
  sprite drawing onto a world-unit canvas upscaled with `image-rendering:
pixelated`; enemies swap to generated wounded sprite variants as hp falls
  per `config.WOUNDS`, and a boss in its last stand flickers),
  `tiers.ts` (tier name colors), `sfx/` (engine events →
  synthesized 16-bit-palette sounds, organized by domain: `ui.ts`,
  `combat.ts`, `world.ts`, `pickups.ts`, `jingles.ts` behind `index.ts`),
  `music/` (one score file per track — `title.ts`, `level.ts`,
  `spacez.ts` — each holding all instruments + notes as tracker-style
  pattern data, arranged to loop at ~2 minutes; `index.ts` owns the single
  player and a `LEVEL_TRACKS` registry, so a level's `music` id selects its
  theme and `playLevelMusic(trackId)` switches cleanly between levels),
  `audio.ts` (one shared synth split into SFX/music volume views),
  `settings.ts` (persisted control-scheme + volume settings), `characters.ts`
  (persistent named **characters** — the Diablo-style save model: each hero
  owns one evolving build carried into every difficulty, plus per-difficulty
  clear/beaten bookmarks that unlock the ladder in order and open a
  difficulty's free level-select once beaten; a SOFTCORE death banks the run's
  build so the hero keeps the levels, stats and items earned it and just
  restarts the level, while HARDCORE is per-character permadeath — a death
  retires the hero for good, chosen at creation in `CharacterScreen.tsx`),
  `highscores.ts`
  (per-difficulty banked runs — survival
  time, kills, player level reached, and a full end-of-run session snapshot —
  feeding the end-of-run best time and the menu's browsable HIGH SCORES board,
  ranked four ways, with its per-run detail card),
  `assets.ts` (loads the generated sprite atlas — one PNG + JSON source
  rects sliced into per-sprite bitmaps in a single decode — plus the pixel
  font), and `assets/` (the generated atlas + font atlas — never
  hand-edited).
- **`website/src/lib/`** — generic game UI plumbing imported via the
  `@ui/lib/*` alias and earmarked for oss-framework extraction:
  `game-loop.ts` (fixed-timestep rAF loop), `pointer.ts` (pointer gestures:
  hold/hover steering state, taps with finger count, press edges),
  `synth.ts` (WebAudio SFX synth with 16-bit voice features — attack
  envelopes, detuned dual oscillators, vibrato, stereo pan, biquad
  filters, and a shared SNES-style echo bus; the game ships zero audio
  files), `chiptune.ts` (the 16-bit-style music sequencer: named
  instrument patches + patterns + an order arrangement, scheduled on the
  synth), `pixel-font.ts` + `PixelText.tsx` (runtime renderer for
  the generated bitmap font), `flag-store.ts` (a persisted string-flag set
  with graceful no-storage fallback), `load-images.ts`.
- **`website/scripts/asset-tools/` + `sprite-data/` +
  `generate-assets.mjs`** — the pixel-asset pipeline (`make assets`):
  sprites are character grids organized in per-family modules, each with a
  local palette scope merged with a shared core (`sprite-data/core.mjs`),
  rendered at build time into one committed sprite atlas (PNG + JSON
  source rects) plus gitignored previews (per-family contact sheets, film
  strips, palette sheet, font specimen). Wound styles derive from the
  enemy catalog's `gore` field and role; contrast lints flag sprites that
  dissolve into their family's ground and wound overlays that don't read.
  See the `pixel-assets` skill.
- **`website/scripts/playtest.mjs`** — the autoplay bot that drives real
  runs headlessly through the `?debug` state hook. See the `playtest`
  skill.
- **`website/scripts/cutscene-preview.mjs`** — the scene review harness:
  plays one cutscene in headless Chromium via the workbench and
  screenshots every beat into `website/assets-preview/cutscenes/<id>/`,
  so a scene edit is reviewed like a storyboard contact sheet.
- **`website/pwa-plugin.ts`** — emits the service worker, `version.json`,
  and `precache-manifest.json` at build time (the pattern is borrowed from
  the oss-framework demo). The worker precaches the app shell, parks new
  builds in `waiting`, and only takes over when the player accepts the
  update toast — a mid-run silent refresh would destroy the run.
- **`website/src/app/pwa.ts`** — the per-slot precache cache id shared by
  the plugin (Node side) and the app (browser side).
- **`website/scripts/`** — source-data extraction (§11.2), SEO generation
  (sitemap/robots/llms/404, §11.3), and the structural SEO checker
  (§11.3.10).

The app consumes
[`@niclaslindstedt/oss-framework`](https://github.com/niclaslindstedt/oss-framework)
for local-first PWA plumbing (today: the `usePwaUpdate` lifecycle hook; the
"a new version is ready" prompt itself is the game's own sprite-styled
`website/src/game/UpdateModal.tsx`, in place of the framework's plain
`UpdateToast`, so it matches the pixel-art dressing). Game-agnostic code is
kept in the dedicated `src/lib/` and
`website/src/lib/` areas so it can be extracted into the framework for reuse
in later games once it has matured through playtesting — see `AGENTS.md` for
the policy.

## Deployment topology

GitHub Pages serves three deploy slots on one origin — the `siteUrl` in
`game.config.json`, a custom domain (CNAME) on the GitHub Pages origin —
assembled by a single `pages.yml` run into one artifact:

| Slot       | URL         | Source                                                                                     | Indexed        |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| Production | `/`         | Highest `v*` tag (or `main` before the first release)                                      | Yes            |
| Staging    | `/preview/` | `main` HEAD, every push                                                                    | No (`noindex`) |
| Branch     | `/branch/`  | Last branch parked via `workflow_dispatch`, persisted in the `branch-deploy` orphan branch | No (`noindex`) |

Each slot is built separately with its own `VITE_BASE`, gets its own service
worker scoped to its base, and a disjoint precache id (`game`,
`game-preview`, `game-branch`) so the builds never poison each other. The
production worker's scope covers the nested slots, so it carries a
navigation denylist and refuses to answer their navigations.

Releases: a maintainer dispatches `release.yml`, which derives the semver
bump from the changeset fragments in `.changes/unreleased/` (front-matter
`type` + optional `breaking: true` — see `scripts/release/compute-bump.mjs`;
an explicit patch/minor/major input overrides it), consumes the fragments
into a new dated `CHANGELOG.md` section, rewrites every version string
(`scripts/update-versions.sh`), runs the build + tests, commits and tags
`vX.Y.Z` on `main`, publishes a GitHub Release, and chains into `pages.yml`
so the new tag is live at the site root immediately. Everything happens in
one dispatched run with the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` — no `RELEASE_TOKEN` PAT.
Every PR that touches user-visible code must add a fragment under
`.changes/unreleased/` (CI's `changeset` job enforces it; label a PR
`no-changelog` to opt out).

## Extension points (for improved mechanics)

New _content_ on an existing mechanic is pure data — a new enemy, weapon,
level, or ability is a catalog entry, no code. New _archetypes_ (a mechanic
the engine has no shape for yet) require touching a closed union and each
site that switches on it. The unions and their handler sites:

| Union (types.ts / defs)           | Members                                                             | Handler sites to extend                                                                                              |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `EnemyRole` (defs/enemies/)       | `minion` \| `elite` \| `boss`                                       | `step.ts` enemy AI (aggro/guard/boss branches, last-stand), `create.ts` boss-spawn detection, `render.ts` hp bars    |
| `AbilityKind` (defs/abilities.ts) | `orbit` \| `storm` \| `stasis` \| `nuke` \| `magnet`                | capability-object dispatch in `abilities.ts` + `step.ts`; visuals in `render.ts` `drawAbilities`                     |
| `Item["kind"]` (types.ts)         | `medkit` \| `xp` \| `repair` \| `equipment` \| `ability` \| `story` | the pickup switch in `step.ts`; the item-sprite switch in `render.ts`                                                |
| `Affix["kind"]` (types.ts)        | `damagePct` \| `maxHp` \| `crit` \| `stat`                          | the affix readers in `items.ts` (`effectiveStat`, `computeMaxHp`, `playerCritChance`, `weaponDamage`, `weaponScore`) |
| `Quality` (types.ts)              | `broken` \| `crude` \| `normal` \| `superior` \| `perfect`          | config `QUALITY.mults`/weights, `QUALITY_PREFIX` (defs/equipment.ts), the roll in `items.ts` `rollQuality`           |

**Checklist to add an archetype:** union entry → def field(s) it needs → the
`step.ts` (or `items.ts`/`abilities.ts`) handler branch → a `GameEvent`
variant if the app must react → a headless test in `tests/` → the render +
SFX mapping in `website/`. The `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch` /
`verbatimModuleSyntax` compiler settings make a missed switch arm a type
error, so the compiler points at every site you still owe.

## Making a sequel / new game

A sequel is a clone of this repo with the first game's content stripped and
new content built on the same engine. The mechanical playbook is the
`new-game` skill (`.agent/skills/new-game/SKILL.md`): rename via
`game.config.json`, strip the content catalogs and this game's docs/tests,
then rebuild content with the `engine-system`, `pixel-assets`,
`sound-effects`, and `playtest` skills. This game's content walkthrough lives
in [`game-content.md`](./game-content.md) so a sequel replaces it wholesale.

## Design decisions

- **Engine/app split** — gameplay logic stays renderer-agnostic so it can be
  unit-tested in Node without a DOM, and so a future renderer change (canvas
  → WebGL/WebGPU) never touches game rules.
- **Hand-rolled service worker over Workbox** — the framework's
  `usePwaUpdate` needs three emitted files and one cache-naming convention;
  emitting them from a small Vite plugin is cheaper than adopting the
  Workbox toolchain, and the update flow stays fully inspectable.
- **Events over callbacks** — the simulation reports what happened
  (`GameEvent[]` per step) and the app decides how to present it. Sound,
  screen flashes, and future particles hang off the same channel without
  the engine growing presentation hooks.
- **Generated assets over binaries** — sprites, tiles, and the UI font
  ship as two committed atlases (sprite atlas + font atlas), but their
  sources of truth are reviewable text (pixel grids, palette ramps, glyph
  definitions) rendered by `make assets`. Art is diffable and
  agent-editable like any other code.
- **Synthesized audio over audio files** — every sound is a handful of
  WebAudio oscillator/noise parameters in `website/src/game/sfx/`, and
  the background music is tracker-style score data (one file per track
  under `website/src/game/music/`, instruments + patterns + arrangement)
  played by a small sequencer (`@ui/lib/chiptune.ts`) on the same synth —
  the offline PWA payload stays tiny and every tune is diffable code.
